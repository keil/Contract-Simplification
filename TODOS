- Questions

- A possibility to simplify examples
- e.g. by using the Names ,Nat instead of the predicate?
- use preducate names and unroll only when needed.


- how can I guarantee that I do not create more contract, for example 
- because some value is not used




- normale code optimization required,
- this means 
etwa reduction
\X.X -> X
