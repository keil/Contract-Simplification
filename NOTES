*** Predicate Optimization

Baseline Optimization
=====================

Reduces Flat Contracts
----------------------

Reduces all flat contracts that can be checked at compile time. In particular
this are all:

i) c @ (flat e) 
ii) \ x e @ (flat e)

Only c @ (flat e) expressions remain.

Reduce Function Contracts
-------------------------

Reduces all function contracts on non-function objects.

c @ (C -> D)

Only function contracts on function (contracted functions) remain.
